This application is used to easily deploy Guidewire environment. Each user has it's own independant environment that can be used for various purposes.

## How to use the app

1. To deploy your own Guidewire environment click onto this icon :

    <img src="deploy.png" alt="drawing" width="75"/>
2. Depending of your case choose the right tab and this will display the list of **pods** that are available.
    > A **pod** is an independant Guidewire environment that can be deploy on command. 

    Each item of the list is composed this way : <span style="text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-color: red;">SME-TRN-01</span> is the name of the pod, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-color:green;"> first URL</span> linked to the Guidewire environment and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-color: blue;">second</span> is to consult the reports associated with the specified environment :

   Click on the name of the pod, in this case <span style="color:red">SME-TRN-01</span> to show more details.
